  title: "Career Advice for Programmers"
  description: "Do you know how to remain a programmer? To avoid being “promoted” into positions away from technology and code? Did they teach you at university that you need social skills to be a good developer? What other skills do you need that aren't technical? Did you know that all development roles are not created equal? Is it true that moving jobs a lot is a Bad Thing?

                In this session, Trisha Gee (Java Champion, 2015 MongoDB Master, 2016/2014/2012 JavaOne Rock Star & Technical Advocate for JetBrains) will share some lessons she learnt the hard way over nearly twenty years of managing her career as a Java developer. She'll talk about what's really important to developers when thinking about their careers, and give you tools for working out what your next steps are.

                If nothing else, you’ll get to laugh at the (many) mistakes I’ve made in my search for The Perfect Job."

  description: "Para un mismo problema existe más de una solución aunque a veces existen barreras tecnicas que nos impiden abordarlas. Esta presentación pretende mostrar como, gracias a Kotlin, se nos abren otras opciones a la hora de abordar los problemas, centrandonos en nuestros problemas particulares y delegando a un segundo plano problemas recurrentes como la gestión de errores o la concurrencia."

  description: "Are you trying to set up Continuous Delivery in your company and it’s being harder than expected? What do you really need to reach Continuous Delivery? You can achieve this based on best efforts, but
  time is not infinite and this does not scale. How can you evolve your company to reach it? Avoid the enemies of Continuous Delivery:
                <ul>
                <li>Manual testing</li>
                <li>Manual processes</li>
                <li>Poor automated tests (unstable, slow and with bad scope of testing)</li>
                <li>Lack of coordination</li>
                <li>Bad communication</li>
                <li>No clear responsibliities</li></ul>"
